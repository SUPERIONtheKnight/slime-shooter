#My first game that I am attempting to get working on the Unity game engine that simply isn't a copycat follow-through tutorial. I've done this in the past on gamemaker studios, but I've never actually finished said games. My hope, is that will change with this one. :)

#The idea for this game is a puzzle game where you can shoot slime, and use that slime to do differing things. For example, I should be able to shoot slime at a #wall, jump into it and stick to the wall, then be able to jump out of the slime further up onto a platform.
